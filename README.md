## Introduction

This repository contains the R code and supplementary material for the paper titled "Two Paradoxes in Women's Wellbeing" by C. Kaiser, N. Muggleton, E. Quispe-Torreblanca, and J.-E. De Neve.
The repository provides analyses of gender differences in life evaluation, positive and negative affect, and pain using three datasets: Gallup World Poll (GWP), Eurobarometer, and General Social Survey (GSS).
The paper explores gender paradoxes in subjective wellbeing, presenting both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.



## Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this repository, you will have to:

1. Download the necessary datasets (see Replication and data Requirements); and
2. Run the code (see Running the R scripts)

### Replication and data requirements

Various parts of the data cannot be made public, although we have included `DataSources.txt` files to clarify how we accessed the data.

### Running the R Scripts

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need a working installation of R with all the necessary package dependencies.
Set working directory to the `code` repo.
We recommend using the `renv` package for managing dependencies and ensuring a reproducible environment.

#### Steps to Set Up the Environment:

1. Install the `renv` package in R if you don’t have it:
```R
   install.packages("renv")
```  

2. Once renv is installed, navigate to the project directory in R and run:

```R
renv::restore()
```  

This command will install all the required packages listed in the `renv.lock` file to your environment.

If you encounter any issues with package installations, ensure that your system is configured with the appropriate R version and that any system dependencies for certain packages (e.g., `data.table`, `ggplot2`) are met.

By using renv, you’ll have the same R environment as the one used to develop this project, which will give consistent results.
